## notes
- since 2018, the entire 70 person team, spread across 16 countries, works remotely - https://www.codementor.io/blog/how-hotjar-manages-its-remote-team-effectively-2flastp245
- the company manages its budget in an interesting way - each department is given a budget based on a percentage of the revenue and manages it internally with no regulations - Each employee has their own budget, as well! 
- David had 12 years of experience in visual, e-marketing and business project management - failed in 2 startups before Hotjar
